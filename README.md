## 🚀 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Build confidence with pattern recognition and problem-solving techniques
- Complete 8-10 easy problems
- Focus on arrays, strings, and basic data structures
- Practice time/space complexity analysis

### Phase 2: Core Algorithm Patterns (Weeks 3-6)
**Goal**: Master essential algorithms in target categories
- **Dynamic Programming**: Start with Fibonacci, climbing stairs, then move to knapsack
- **Graphs & Search**: BFS/DFS traversal, path finding, connected components
- Mix of easy and medium problems

### Phase 3: Advanced Patterns (Weeks 7-10)
**Goal**: Tackle complex variations and combinations
- Advanced DP patterns (memoization, tabulation)
- Graph algorithms (Dijkstra, topological sort)
- Problem combinations testing multiple concepts

## 📝 Problem Template

Each solution follows this structure:

```python
class Solution:
    def problem_name(self, inputs) -> output_type:
        """
        Problem: [Problem Title]
        Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
        Category: [Algorithm Category]

        Approach: [Brief description of solution approach]
        Time Complexity: O(...)
        Space Complexity: O(...)
        """
        # Implementation
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test cases and examples
    pass
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- Comprehensive unit tests using Python's `unittest` framework
- Edge case coverage for all solutions
- Performance benchmarking for optimization
- Multiple solution approaches comparison
